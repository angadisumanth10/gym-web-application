Main Components of the System

Membership Plans. The plan list helps organize the member’s selected plan for his/her membership with the fitness gym. Each plan are one-time payment only, which means that the membership fee of the members are based on their selected plan. This refers to how long the member will be marked as an active member in the fitness gym.

Packages List. The packages list refers to the list of packages that the fitness gym management offers to their members. This program of the fitness gym is payable by month until the expiration of the member’s membership.

Trainers List. The trainer list will be used if the member will hire also a trainer if every trainer is not included in his/her package. The trainer’s rate will be added to the monthly amount payable to the member.

Renewal of Membership. The membership can be renewed when the fitness gym member’s membership plan will expire, which means the member can extend his/her membership, and the gym management system will include the membership fee again to the first-month payment of the member after his/her previous membership expires.

Change of Membership Plan or Packages. The gym management or the system user must end the plan of the member if the member will change his/her membership plan or packages after his/her previous membership plan expires to allow the system to know that the member is not active anymore in any membership plan and packages.
